This repository uses NLP to summarize a article.


Text summarization alludes to the procedure of shortening long bits of text. The expectation is to make a reasonable and familiar text having just the central matters plot in the record.

Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).


 # Need for text summarization?
 
Impelled by the advanced mechanical developments, information is to this century what oil was to the past one. Today, our reality is dropped by the social event and scattering of huge information. 

Truth be told, the International Data Corporation (IDC) ventures that the aggregate sum of computerized information flowing every year around the globe would grow from 4.4 zettabytes in 2013 to hit 180 zettabytes in 2025. That is a great deal of data! 

With such a major measure of information circling in the computerized space, there is a need to have AI algorithm that can naturally abbreviate longer messages and convey exact meaning that can easily  summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages. 

Besides, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can fit in an area.


# Main approaches to automatic summarization?


There are two main types of how to summarize text in NLP:

# Extraction-based summarization

The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts.
Here is an example:
Source text: Joseph and Mary rode on a donkey to attend the annual event in Jerusalem. In the city, Mary gave birth to a child named Jesus.
Extractive summary: Joseph and Mary attend event Jerusalem. Mary birth Jesus.
As you can see above, the words in bold have been extracted and joined to create a summary — although sometimes the summary can be grammatically strange.

# Abstraction-based summarization
The abstraction technique entails paraphrasing and shortening parts of the source document. When abstraction is applied for text summarization in deep learning problems, it can overcome the grammar inconsistencies of the extractive method.
The abstractive text summarization algorithms create new phrases and sentences that relay the most useful information from the original text — just like humans do.
Therefore, abstraction performs better than extraction. However, the text summarization algorithms required to do abstraction are more difficult to develop; that’s why the use of extraction is still popular.
Here is an example:
Abstractive summary: Joseph and Mary came to Jerusalem where Jesus was born.
